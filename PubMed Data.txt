AB  - Uterine fibroids are benign monoclonal neoplasms of the myometrium, representing 
      the most common tumors in women worldwide. To date, no long-term or noninvasive 
      treatment option exists for hormone-dependent uterine fibroids, due to the 
      limited knowledge about the molecular mechanisms underlying the initiation and 
      development of uterine fibroids. This paper comprehensively summarizes the recent 
      research advances on uterine fibroids, focusing on risk factors, development 
      origin, pathogenetic mechanisms, and treatment options. Additionally, we describe 
      the current treatment interventions for uterine fibroids. Finally, future 
      perspectives on uterine fibroids studies are summarized. Deeper mechanistic 
      insights into tumor etiology and the complexity of uterine fibroids can 
      contribute to the progress of newer targeted therapies.

AB  - Uterine myomas or fibroids are the most common benign female tumors of the 
      reproductive organs, associated with significant morbidity and quality of life 
      impairment. Several epidemiological risk factors for their occurrence have been 
      identified so far, including nutrition and dietary habits. In this investigation, 
      authors reviewed, as a narrative review, the data about diet and uterine myoma 
      development in order to homogenize the current data. A PubMed search was 
      conducted for the years 1990-2020, using a combination of keywords of interest 
      for the selected topic. The authors searched the databases, selecting the 
      randomized clinical studies, the observational studies, and the basic 
      (experimental), clinical, and epidemiological researches. Once they collected the 
      articles, they analyzed them according to the number of citations of each 
      article, starting from the most cited to the least cited articles. Subsequently, 
      authors collected the data of each article and inserted them in the various 
      research paragraphs, summarizing the data collected. In this way, they crossed 
      the available data regarding the association between nutrition habits and dietary 
      components and myoma onset and growth. Many nutrients and dietary habits are 
      associated with myoma development risk. These factors include low intakes of 
      fruit, vegetables, and vitamin D, as well as pollutants in food. Despite the 
      available data on the influence of some foods on the development of fibroids, 
      further research is mandatory to understand all the nutrition risk factors which 
      contribute to myoma growth and how exactly these risk factors influence myoma 
      pathogenesis.

AB  - A healthy lifestyle and a balanced diet play a paramount role in promoting and 
      maintaining homeostatic functions and preventing an array of chronic and 
      debilitating diseases. Based upon observational and epidemiological 
      investigations, it is clear that nutritional factors and dietary habits play a 
      significant role in gynecological disease development, including uterine 
      leiomyoma, endometriosis, polycystic ovary syndrome, and gynecological 
      malignancies. Diets rich in fruits and vegetables, Mediterranean diets, green 
      tea, vitamin D, and plant-derived natural compounds may have a long-term positive 
      impact on gynecological diseases, while fats, red meat, alcohol, and coffee may 
      contribute to their development. Data regarding the association between dietary 
      habits and gynecological disorders are, at times, conflicting, with potential 
      confounding factors, including food pollutants, reduced physical activity, ethnic 
      background, and environmental factors limiting overall conclusions. This review 
      provides a synopsis of the current clinical data and biological basis of the 
      association between available dietary and nutritional data, along with their 
      impact on the biology and pathophysiology of different gynecological disorders, 
      as well as an outlook on future directions that will guide further 
      investigational research.

AB  - Uterine fibroids, also known as uterine leiomyoma (UL), are monoclonal tumors of 
      the smooth muscle tissue layer (myometrium) of the uterus. Although ULs are 
      considered benign, uterine fibroids are the source of major quality-of-life 
      issues for approximately 25% of all women, who suffer from clinically significant 
      symptoms of UL. Despite the prevalence of UL, there is no treatment option for UL 
      which is long term, cost-effective, and leaves fertility intact. The lack of 
      understanding about the etiology of UL contributes to the scarcity of medical 
      therapies available. Studies have identified an important role for sex steroid 
      hormones in the pathogenesis of UL, and have driven the use of hormonal treatment 
      for fibroids, with mixed results. Dysregulation of cell signaling pathways, miRNA 
      expression, and cytogenetic abnormalities have also been implicated in UL 
      etiology. Recent discoveries on the etiology of UL and the development of 
      relevant genetically modified rodent models of UL have started to revitalize UL 
      research. This review outlines the major characteristics of fibroids; major 
      contributors to UL etiology, including steroid hormones; and available 
      preclinical animal models for UL.

TI  - Vitamin D and Uterine Fibroids-Review of the Literature and Novel Concepts.
LID - 10.3390/ijms19072051 [doi]
LID - 2051
AB  - This article provides a detailed review of current knowledge on the role of 
      vitamin D and its receptor in the biology and management of uterine fibroids 
      (UFs). Authors present ideas for future steps in this area. A literature search 
      was conducted in PubMed using the following key words: "uterine fibroid" and 
      "vitamin D". The results of the available studies, published in English from 
      January 2002 up to April 2018, have been discussed. Vitamin D is a group of 
      steroid compounds with a powerful impact on many parts of the human body. This 
      vitamin is believed to regulate cell proliferation and differentiation, inhibit 
      angiogenesis, and stimulate apoptosis. Nowadays, hypovitaminosis D is believed to 
      be a major risk factor in the development of UFs. In many studies vitamin D 
      appears to be a powerful factor against UFs, resulting in inhibition of tumor 
      cell division and a significant reduction in its size, however, the exact role of 
      this compound and its receptor in the pathophysiology of UFs is not fully 
      understood. According to available studies, vitamin D and its analogs seem to be 
      promising, effective, and low-cost compounds in the management of UFs and their 
      clinical symptoms, and the anti-tumor activities of vitamin D play an important 
      role in UF biology. The synergy between vitamin D and selected anti-UF drugs is a 
      very interesting issue which requires further research. Further studies about the 
      biological effect of vitamin D on UF biology are essential. Vitamin D 
      preparations (alone or as a co-drugs) could become new tools in the fight with 
      UFs, with the additional beneficial pleiotropic effect.

TI  - Alcohol consumption and risk of uterine myoma: A systematic review and meta 
      analysis.
PG  - e0188355

AB  - BACKGROUND: The published data about alcohol consumption and uterine myoma are 
      scanty and controversial: some studies found positive association whereas other 
      studies showed no association. OBJECTIVES: To conduct a systematic review and 
      meta-analysis to determine whether alcohol is a risk factor for myoma. SEARCH 
      STRATEGY: A MEDLINE/EMBASE search was carried out, supplemented by manual 
      searches of bibliographies of the selected studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: Articles 
      published as full-length papers in English. In the review we included all 
      identified studies. Otherwise, the inclusion criteria for studies included in the 
      meta-analysis were: a) case-control or cohort studies, reporting original data; 
      b) studies reporting original data on the association between alcohol consumption 
      and myoma; c) diagnosis of myoma was ultrasound or histological confirmed and/or 
      clinically based. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: A total of 6 studies were 
      identified for the review and 5 studies were included in the meta-analysis. The 
      primary outcome was the incidence of uterine myoma in ever versus never alcohol 
      drinkers and when data were available, we also analyzed categories of alcohol 
      intake. We assessed the outcomes in the overall population and then we performed 
      a subgroup analysis according to study design. Pooled estimates of the odds 
      ratios (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using random 
      effects models. MAIN RESULTS: The summary OR (95%CI) of myoma forever versus 
      never alcohol intake was 1.12 (0.94-1.34) with significant heterogeneity. The 
      summary OR for current versus never drinking was 1.33 (1.01-1.76) with no 
      heterogeneity. CONCLUSIONS: Ever alcohol consumption is not associated with myoma 
      risk. Based on the data of two studies, current alcohol drinkers had a slightly 
      borderline increased risk of diagnosis of myoma. In consideration of the very 
      limited number of studies and the suggestion of a potential increased risk among 
      current drinkers, further studies are required.

TI  - Dietary Natural Compounds and Vitamins as Potential Cofactors in Uterine Fibroids 
      Growth and Development.
LID - 10.3390/nu14040734 [doi]
LID - 734
AB  - An analysis of the literature generated within the past 20 year-span concerning 
      risks of uterine fibroids (UFs) occurrence and dietary factors was carried out. A 
      link between Vitamin D deficiency and UFs formation is strongly indicated, making 
      it a potent compound in leiomyoma therapy. Analogs of the 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, 
      not susceptible to degradation by tissue 24-hydroxylase, appear to be especially 
      promising and tend to show better therapeutic results. Although research on the 
      role of Vitamin A in the formation of fibroids is contradictory, Vitamin 
      A-enriched diet, as well as synthetic retinoid analogues, may be preventative or 
      limit the growth of fibroids. Unambiguous conclusions cannot be drawn regarding 
      Vitamin E and C supplementation, except for alpha-tocopherol. Alpha-tocopherol as 
      a phytoestrogen taking part in the modulation of estrogen receptors (ERs) 
      involved in UF etiology, should be particularly avoided in therapy. A diet 
      enriched in fruits and vegetables, as sources of carotenoids, polyphenols, 
      quercetin, and indole-3-carbinol, constitutes an easily modifiable lifestyle 
      element with beneficial results in patients with UFs. Other natural substances, 
      such as curcumin, can reduce the oxidative stress and protect against 
      inflammation in leiomyoma. Although the exact effect of probiotics on uterine 
      fibroids has not yet been thoroughly evaluated at this point, the protective role 
      of dairy products, i.e., yogurt consumption, has been indicated. Trace elements 
      such as selenium can also contribute to antioxidative and anti-inflammatory 
      properties of a recommended diet. In contrast, heavy metals, endocrine disrupting 
      chemicals, cigarette smoking, and a diet low in antioxidants and fiber were, 
      alongside genetic predispositions, associated with UFs formation.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Uterine leiomyoma is the most common benign tumor in 
      females of reproductive age. However, its causes have never been fully 
      understood. The objective of our study was to analyze the causal association 
      between various factors and uterine leiomyoma using Mendelian randomization (MR). 
      METHODS: Genetic variables associated with risk factors were obtained from 
      genome-wide association studies. Summary-level statistical data for uterine 
      leiomyoma were obtained from FinnGen and the UK Biobank (UKB) consortium. We used 
      inverse variance weighted, MR-Egger, and weighted median methods in univariate 
      analysis. Multivariable MR analysis was used to identify independent risk 
      factors. A fixed-effect model meta-analysis was used to combine the results of 
      the FinnGen and UKB data. RESULTS: In the FinnGen data, higher genetically 
      predicted age at natural menopause, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic 
      blood pressure (DBP), and fasting insulin were associated with an increased risk 
      of uterine leiomyoma, while higher age at menarche was associated with a reduced 
      risk of uterine leiomyoma. Multivariable MR analysis of SBP and DBP showed that 
      higher DBP might be an independent risk factor of uterine leiomyoma. In the UKB 
      data, the results for age at natural menopause, SBP, DBP, and age at menarche 
      were replicated. The result of the meta-analysis suggested that uterine leiomyoma 
      could also be affected by polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), endometriosis, and 
      2-hour glucose level. CONCLUSION: Our MR study confirmed that earlier menstrual 
      age, hypertension, obesity, and elevated 2-hour glucose post-challenge were risk 
      factors for uterine leiomyoma, and the causal relationship between smoking and 
      uterine leiomyoma was ruled out. In addition, later age of menopause and 
      endometriosis were found to increase the risk of uterine leiomyoma, while PCOS 
      was found to decrease the risk.

TI  - The Role of Nutrition in Pathogenesis of Uterine Fibroids.
LID - 10.3390/nu15234984 [doi]
LID - 4984
AB  - Uterine fibroids are benign tumors that arise from the smooth muscle tissue of 
      the uterus and are the most common tumors in women. Due to their high prevalence, 
      costs for the health care system and the substantial impact on women's quality of 
      life, they are a significant public health concern. Previous literature on the 
      impact of diet on the occurrence, growth and symptoms of fibroids is limited. 
      Recently, many papers have been written on this topic. A scoping review of PubMed 
      and Cochrane databases was performed using the following keywords: uterine 
      fibroids, antioxidants, diet, diet, vegetarian, vegetables, fruits, meat and soy 
      foods, dairy products, tea, vitamin D, vitamin C, ascorbic acid. Preliminary 
      research has shown a beneficial effect of vegetable and fruit consumption on the 
      occurrence of fibroids. A relationship between hypovitaminosis D and an increased 
      risk of fibroids has also been demonstrated. Studies on epigallocatechin gallate 
      showed its apoptosis-promoting and antifibrinolytic effect in fibroid cells. 
      Initial results are promising, but further randomized trials are needed to draw 
      firm conclusions about the effects of diet and nutrients on uterine fibroids.

AB  - Uterine leiomyomas, also called uterine fibroids or myomas, represent one of the 
      most common benign tumour types in women of a fertile age. Leiomyomas arise due 
      to transformation of the layer of smooth muscle cells of corpus uteri - the 
      myometrium. Despite frequent occurrence of this disease, the molecular mechanisms 
      behind the origin and development of leiomyomas are still relatively unknown. 
      Most predisposed are obese women and women of African origin. In more than half 
      of cases, leiomyomas remain asymptomatic. Genetic factors also have an important 
      impact on the development of these hormone-dependent tumours. However, the 
      clinical and molecular characteristics of familiar and sporadic leiomyomas can 
      widely differ. The main reason is the heterogeneity of this disease and the 
      abundance of factors which can underlie their tumourigenesis. Clinical diagnosis 
      of uterine leiomyomas without surgical interference can be hindered in the case 
      of small, mostly submucosal leiomyomas or if it is necessary to avoid potential 
      malignancy of tumour. Also, medical treatment of uterine leiomyomas cannot be 
      nowadays considered sufficient with many medical agents still being tested only 
      within clinical research. The main goal of this article is to summarise known 
      facts about the aetiology of leiomyomas, risk factors that contribute to their 
      development, known molecular-genetic aberrations connected with the presence of 
      leiomyomas as well as the possibilities of their diagnosis and treatment.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To provide a detailed summary of current scientific knowledge on 
      uterine fibroids (leiomyomas) in vitro and in in vivo animal models, as well as 
      to postulate the potential role of vitamin D3 as an effective, inexpensive, safe, 
      long-term treatment option for uterine fibroids. DESIGN: PubMed search articles 
      were used to identify the most relevant studies on uterine fibroids, as well as 
      effects of vitamin D3 on uterine fibroid cells and fibroid tumor growth in 
      in vivo animal models. SETTING: University research laboratory. PATIENT(S): Not 
      applicable. INTERVENTION(S): None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Not applicable. 
      RESULT(S): Despite numerous publications available on uterine fibroids, 
      information about the role that vitamin D3 plays in the regulation of uterine 
      fibroids is limited. Most of the recent vitamin D3-related studies on uterine 
      fibroids were published from our group. Recent studies have demonstrated that 
      vitamin D deficiency plays a significant role in the development of uterine 
      fibroids. Our recent studies have demonstrated that vitamin D3 reduces leiomyoma 
      cell proliferation in vitro and leiomyoma tumor growth in in vivo animal models. 
      These results postulate the potential role of vitamin D3 for an effective, safe, 
      nonsurgical medical treatment option for uterine fibroids. CONCLUSION(S): This 
      article reviews human and animal studies and uncovers new possibilities for 
      understanding the vitamin D-based therapeutic option for an effective, safe, 
      long-term treatment of uterine fibroids. On the basis of these results, a 
      clinical trial with vitamin D3 or a hypocalcemic analog, paricalcitol, may be 
      warranted for nonsurgical medical treatment of uterine fibroids.

TI  - The environmental risk factors prior to conception associated with placental 
      abruption: an umbrella review.
PG  - 55

LID - 55
AB  - BACKGROUND: The present umbrella review evaluated risk factors prior to 
      conception associated with placental abruption based on meta-analyses and 
      systematic reviews. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science until 
      June 25, 2021. All meta-analyses that had focused on assessing the risk factors 
      associated with placental abruption were included. We calculated summary effect 
      estimates, 95% CI, heterogeneity I(2), 95% prediction interval, small-study 
      effects, excess significance biases, and sensitive analysis. The quality of the 
      meta-analyses was evaluated with A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews 
      2 (AMSTAR 2). RESULTS: There was no risk factor in the present umbrella review 
      with the high level of evidence (class I or II). Eight risk factors including 
      maternal asthma (RR 1.29 95% CI 1.14, 1.47), prior cesarean section (RR 1.38, 95% 
      CI 1.35-1.42), cocaine using (RR 4.55, 95% CI 1.78-6.50), endometriosis (OR 1.40, 
      95% CI 1.12-1.76), chronic hypertension (OR 3.13, 95% CI 2.04-4.80), advanced 
      maternal age (OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.35-1.54), maternal smoking (OR 1.80, 95% CI 
      1.75-1.85) (RR 1.65, 95% CI 1.51-1.80), and use of assisted reproductive 
      techniques (ART) (OR 1.87, 95% CI 1.70-2.06) were graded as suggestive evidence 
      (class III). The other four risk factors including pre-pregnancy underweight (OR 
      1.38, 95% CI 1.12-1.70), preeclampsia (OR 1.73, 95% CI 1.47-2.04), uterine 
      leiomyoma (OR 2.63, 95% CI 1.38-3.88), and marijuana use (OR 1.78, 95% CI 
      1.32-2.40) were graded as risk factors with weak evidence (class IV). CONCLUSION: 
      Maternal asthma, prior cesarean section, cocaine use, endometriosis, chronic 
      hypertension, advanced maternal age, maternal smoking, and use of ART, 
      pre-pregnancy underweight, preeclampsia, uterine leiomyoma, and marijuana use 
      were risk factors associated with placental abruption. Although factors 
      associated with placental abruption have been investigated, the current 
      meta-analytic associations cannot disentangle the complex etiology of placental 
      abruption mainly due to their low quality of evidence.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Many women of premenopausal age suffer from uterine leiomyomas, 
      which are benign tumors of the uterus. Despite the high prevalence of uterine 
      leiomyomas underlying pathogenesis mechanisms are not fully elucidated. Early 
      data showed a positive correlation between increased levels of adipose tissue and 
      leiomyomas prevalence. Adipose tissue cells-adipocytes can play a potential role 
      in leiomyomas formation by producing and secreting adipokines. AIM: The aim of 
      this study is to summarize the current knowledge on the potential relation 
      between adipokines and leiomyomas basing on current data analyze, and justify 
      future research directions. METHODOLOGY: This review is based on pertinent 
      articles searched using PubMed, encompassing all available literature. The key 
      search words were as follows: adipokines, leiomyoma, TNFα, leptin, adiponectin, 
      visfatin, resistin, omentin, lipocalin, apelin, adipsin, chemerin. Time was not 
      an exclusion criterium due to few available studies on this subject. SUMMARY: The 
      results of the studies are inconclusive, but the vast majority indicates a 
      significant connection between the adipokines and the leiomyomas. According to 
      the majority of studies, TNFα contributes to the development of leiomyomas by 
      inhibiting apoptosis, increasing migration of leiomyomas, and increasing fibrosis 
      of leiomyomas. Most of the studies on the effects of leptin also indicate the 
      relation between leptin and leiomyomas development. In the case of adiponectin 
      released from mast cells' granularity, it is possible that adiponectin increases 
      angiogenesis in leiomyomas. Under physiological conditions, adiponectin has the 
      potential to inhibit the development of leiomyomas. The authors suggested that 
      adiponectin affects leiomyomas via an insulin-dependent pathway or via an 
      estrogen-dependent pathway. Most probably leptin contributes to the formation of 
      myomas and adiponectin prevents this. More research is needed to understand 
      better the influence of these molecules on the pathogenesis of leiomyomas.

AB  - Uterine fibroids (UFs) are the most common tumors of the female genital tract. 
      The effect of UFs on the quality of life and the overall cost of treatment are 
      significant issues worldwide. Tumor size and location are the two specific 
      factors which influence the occurrence of symptoms, the need for, and method of, 
      treatment (some tumors require surgery while some can be treated with selected 
      drugs). Primary prevention and treatment of early UF disease are worthy goals 
      that might have a great impact on health care systems. Several treatments and 
      prophylactic methods can be used in this endeavor. This publication presents 
      current data about lesser-known substances which may have a beneficial effect on 
      the treatment or prophylaxis of UFs and can be administered orally, serving as an 
      alternative to (or complement of) surgery or selective progesterone receptor 
      modulators (SPRMs). Early prevention and treatment of UFs in women from high-risk 
      groups should be our priority. Innovative forms of UF management are under 
      intensive investigation and may be promising options in the near future. Many of 
      them evaluated vitamin D, paricalcitol, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), 
      elagolix, aromatase inhibitors (AIs), and cabergoline and deemed them to be safe 
      and effective. The next step in such projects should be properly constructed 
      randomized control trials (RCTs), carried out by successive phases.

      softerware. 8 case-control studies were included: 3 were about endometrial 
      cancer, 4 were about endometriosis and 1 was about uterine leiomyoma. The result 
      showed no significant association between HSD17B1 rs605059 gene polymorphisms and 
      risks of endometrial cancer (AA vs. AG+GG: OR = 1.11, 95% CI = 0.94-1.32; AA+AG 
      vs. GG: OR = 1.79, 95% CI = 0.42-7.52; AG vs. AA+ GG: OR = 0.87, 95% CI = 
      0.76-1.00; AA vs. GG: OR = 1.43, 95% CI = 0.62-3.30; A vs. G: OR = 1.00, 95% CI = 
      0.91-1.11) or endometriosis (AA vs. AG+GG: OR = 0.99, 95% CI = 0.75-1.32; AA+AG 
      vs. GG: OR = 1.73, 95% CI = 0.92-3.25; AG vs. AA+ GG: OR = 1.24, 95% CI = 
      1.00-1.53; AA vs. GG: OR = 1.54, 95% CI = 0.79-2.97; A vs. G: OR = 1.23, 95% CI = 
      0.90-1.68). No association was found in a subgroup analysis based on Asian 
      ethnicity for endometriosis. This meta-analysis suggested that HSD17B1 rs605059 
      polymorphisms were not associated with the risks of endometrial cancer and 
      endometriosis. Further studies are needed to validate the conclusion and clarify 
      the relationship between HSD17B1 rs605059 polymorphisms and the risk of uterine 
      leiomyoma.

AB  - For a long time, the uterus had been considered a sterile organ, meaning that 
      under physiological conditions the uterus would not be colonized by bacteria. 
      Based on available data, it may be concluded that the gut and uterine microbiome 
      are related, and that the role of this microbiome is greater than expected. 
      Despite being the most common pelvic neoplasms in women of reproductive age, 
      uterine fibroids (UFs) are still poorly understood tumors whose etiology has not 
      been fully determined. This systematic review presents the relationship between 
      intestinal and uterine dysbiosis and uterine fibroids. A systematic review of 
      three medical databases was carried out: the MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus and Cochrane. 
      In this study, 195 titles and abstracts were reviewed, including only original 
      articles and clinical trials of uterine microbiome criteria. Finally, 16 studies 
      were included to the analysis. In recent years, researchers dealing with 
      reproduction in a broad sense have focused on the microbiome in various locations 
      to study its role in the pathogenesis and, consequently, the prevention and 
      treatment of diseases of the genital organ. Conventional microbial detection 
      methods are not suitable for identifying bacteria, which are difficult to 
      culture. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) provides an easier and faster and more 
      informative analysis of bacterial populations. It seems that gut microbiota 
      dysbiosis has the potential to be a risk factor for uterine fibroids or affect 
      the disease process. Some changes were shown in many types of bacteria, such as 
      Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Verrucomicrobia detected in fecal 
      samples in patients with uterine fibroids. In view of the few results on the link 
      between the microbiome and uterine fibroids, further intensive studies in humans 
      and animal models are necessary, including the possible use of different 
      microbiome modulations in the prevention or treatment of uterine fibroids.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Studies, mainly from high-income countries, suggest that there are 
      ethnic and racial variations in prevalence of uterine fibroids (UF). However, 
      there have been few studies of the epidemiology of UF in sub-Saharan Africa 
      (SSA). We reviewed published articles on the epidemiology of UF in SSA. DESIGN: 
      This was a scoping review of literature. SETTINGS: We searched three databases 
      (PubMed, African Wide Information (EBSCO) and African Journals OnLine (AJOL)). 
      The search for eligible articles was conducted between December 2019 and January 
      2021. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: To describe the reported 
      prevalence/incidence of, and risk factors for UF in SSA. RESULTS: Of the 1052 
      articles retrieved, 9 met the inclusion criteria for review. The articles were 
      from Nigeria (4/9), Ghana (2/9), Cameroon (1/9), Kenya (1/9) and South Africa 
      (1/9). Two studies from pathology departments and three studies from radiology 
      departments reported prevalence of UF. We did not find any study on the incidence 
      or genomics of UF in SSA. Of the three studies that reported on the risk factors 
      of UF, only one case-control study that was conducted using retrospective data of 
      attendees at a gynaecological clinic conducted multivariable analysis. 
      CONCLUSION: There is lack of robust epidemiological studies of the prevalence, 
      incidence and risk factors of UF in SSA. There is urgent need to study 
      epidemiological and genomics risk factors of UF in SSA because UF is the most 
      common gynaecological neoplasm in this population where it is associated with 
      significant morbidity and occasional, usually perioperative, mortality.

TI  - The Gut Microbiota: a Novel Player in the Pathogenesis of Uterine Fibroids.
PG  - 3443-3455
LID - 10.1007/s43032-023-01289-7 [doi]
AB  - Uterine fibroid is a common gynecological disorder that affects women of 
      reproductive age and has emerged as a major public health concern. The symptoms 
      have a negative influence on both their physical health and quality of life. The 
      cost of treatment has a significant impact on the disease's burden. Even though 
      its origin is uncertain, estrogen is thought to be a key player in fibroid 
      pathophysiology. Many theories, including those based on genetic and 
      environmental factors, explain what causes hyper-estrogenic condition in fibroid 
      patients. One such possibility that is currently being explored is the hypothesis 
      that an altered gut microbiome can contribute to the development of diseases 
      characterized by estrogen dominance. Gut dysbiosis is often a "hot area" in the 
      health sciences. According to a recent study, uterine fibroid patients have 
      altered gut microbiome. A variety of risk factors influence both fibroid 
      development and gut homeostasis. Diet, lifestyle, physical activity, and 
      environmental contaminants have an impact on estrogen and the gut flora. A better 
      understanding of uterine fibroids' pathophysiology is required to develop 
      effective preventative and treatment options. A few ways by which the gut 
      microbiota contributes to UF include estrogen, impaired immune function, 
      inflammation, and altered gut metabolites. Therefore, in the future, while 
      treating fibroid patients, various strategies to deal with changes in the gut 
      flora may be advantageous. For developing suggestions for clinical diagnosis and 
      therapy, we reviewed the literature on the relationship between uterine fibroids 
      and the gut microbiota.

TI  - The Significance of Measuring Vitamin D Serum Levels in Women with Uterine 
      Fibroids.
PG  - 2098-2109
LID - 10.1007/s43032-020-00363-8 [doi]
AB  - Uterine fibroids (UFs) are benign tumors originating from smooth muscle cells and 
      are considered a common pathology that affects numerous women which is a notable 
      socio-economic problem. Several UF risk factors have been identified including 
      black race, obesity, and vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin D is steroid compound with 
      pleiotropic effects on the human body. Vitamin D deficiency is a major public 
      health concern worldwide. Several studies have shown that the majority of UF 
      patients experienced hypovitaminosis D. In addition, sufficient vitamin D serum 
      levels are associated with the reduced risk of UFs. In this review, we present 
      available data highlighting the importance of measuring vitamin D serum levels in 
      women with UFs and women at a high risk for UF development. We proposed a 
      preliminary clinical instruction of 25-hydroxyvitamin D measurements and vitamin 
      D supplementation for clinicians who are involved in the treatment of patients 
      with UFs. Achieving sufficient serum levels of vitamin D might be of interest in 
      patients with UFs. Screening, supplementation, treatment guidelines, and public 
      health strategies for vitamin D deficiency in women with UFs as well as women at 
      a high risk of UF development might be of potential importance as well.

TI  - Modifiable prognostic factors in uterine fibroid development: a systematic review 
      of literature.
PG  - 2288225
LID - 10.1080/01443615.2023.2288225 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many risk factors in uterine fibroid development have been 
      identified, but women and their physicians are less aware of the influence of 
      lifestyle on uterine fibroid development. The objective of this systematic review 
      is to investigate and summarize modifiable prognostic factors associated with 
      uterine fibroid development. METHODS: Pubmed and Embase were searched for 
      relevant articles according to PRISMA guidelines. References from included 
      articles were screened and when relevant also included. Human in vivo studies on 
      modifiable factors in fibroid development were included. Studies on 
      non-modifiable factors and treatment, in vitro studies and animal studies were 
      excluded. 607 articles were screened and 33 articles were included. Two 
      independent investigators collected data from the report. RESULTS: The strongest 
      risk factor for fibroid development was a high BMI, while the strongest 
      protective factors were a high fruit and vegetable intake and high vitamin D 
      intake. CONCLUSION: More high-quality studies are necessary to better understand 
      the impact of the abovementioned factors as well as the role they play in the 
      growth of already existing fibroids.

OAB - Uterine fibroid development is multifactorial. Various non-modifiable and 
      modifiable factors have been linked to uterine fibroid development. Modifiable 
      factors are controllable by patients themselves. We performed a systematic review 
      to investigate these modifiable factors. We screened 607 articles from 2 
      databases (PubMed and Embase) of which 33 were included in the review. We only 
      included clinical studies on humans. A high body mass index (BMI) is found to be 
      a modifiable risk factor for uterine fibroid development. Protective of uterine 
      fibroid development are high fruit and vegetable intake and high vitamin D intake 
      or sun exposure. More research is needed to investigate the applicability of 
      these findings in clinical practice and to investigate the influence on the 
      growth of already existing uterine fibroids.

PG  - 2-24
LID - 10.1097/GRF.0000000000000164 [doi]
AB  - Uterine leiomyomata (UL) have a substantial impact on women's health, but 
      relatively few studies have identified opportunities for primary prevention of 
      these neoplasms. Most established risk factors are not modifiable, including 
      premenopausal age, African ancestry, age at menarche, and childbearing history. 
      The main challenge in studying UL is that a large proportion of tumors are 
      asymptomatic. Herein, we review the epidemiology of UL from published studies to 
      date. We highlight the advantages of ultrasound screening studies and the ways in 
      which their innovative methods have helped clarify the etiology of disease. We 
      conclude with a discussion of promising new hypotheses.

TI  - Correlation of low serum vitamin-D with uterine leiomyoma: a systematic review

LID - 85
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a growing body of evidence on low serum vitamin-D levels and 
      the risk of uterine leiomyomas (UL). Therefore, this systematic review and 
      meta-analysis was conducted to investigate the association between serum vitamin 
      D levels and UL occurrence. METHODS: Searches were systematically conducted of 
      the electronic databases PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE, Web of Science (ISI), Cochrane 
      library, Ovid, and Google Scholar to identify relevant studies from inception 
      until February 6, 2020. Heterogeneity across the included studies was examined 
      using Cochran's Q and I-square (I(2)). Data was pooled using random effects 
      modeling and expressed as standardized mean differences (SMDs). RESULTS: Nine 
      eligible studies with a total of 1730 participants (835 patients with UL and 895 
      controls) were included in the current meta-analysis. Pooled results with random 
      effects modeling indicated that serum vitamin D levels were significantly lower 
      in patients with UL than in the control group (n = 9, SMD = - 0.67; 95% CI, 
      - 0.98, - 0.35, p < 0.001; I(2) = 89.3%, p < 0.001). Based on the findings of 
      subgroup analyses, it was found that the SMD values across the included studies 
      from Asia (n = 4, SMD = - 1.20; 95% CI, - 1.45, - 0.96, p < 0.001; I(2) = 30.6%, 
      p = 0.229) were lower than those from Europe (n = 3, SMD = - 0.34; 95% CI, 
      - 0.49, - 0.18, p < 0.001; I(2) = 0.0%, p = 0.602) and Africa (n = 2, 
      SMD = - 0.13; 95% CI, - 0.29, 0.04, p = 0.128; I(2) = 0.0%, p = 0.417), although 
      the difference was not significant in Africa. Publication year was also found to 
      be a potential contributor's variable in the pooled SMD using the meta-regression 
      method (t = - 3.00, p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, the 
      current meta-analysis showed for the first time that serum vitamin D levels were 
      significantly lower in women with UL in selected populations.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To conduct a meta-analysis of the studies assessing the effects of 
      mifepristone on the uterus, uterine leiomyoma, and leiomyoma-related symptoms in 
      premenopausal women. DESIGN: Meta-analysis. SETTING: Centers for reproductive 
      care. PATIENT(S): Premenopausal women who suffered from leiomyoma. 
      INTERVENTION(S): We identified all of the studies published before December 2012 
      that compared the status of patients with leiomyoma before and after treatment 
      with mifepristone. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Leiomyoma-related symptoms, uterine 
      or leiomyoma volume, changes in endometrial thickness. RESULT(S): A meta-analytic 
      technique was used to study 11 randomized controlled trials involving 780 women 
      with symptomatic uterine leiomyomas. The subjects received 2.5-25 mg/d of 
      mifepristone for 3-6 months. Mifepristone could effectively reduce uterine and 
      leiomyoma volume and alleviate leiomyoma symptoms, including hypermenorrhea, the 
      mean menstrual blood loss, pelvic pain, pelvic pressure, anemia, and 
      dysmenorrhea. There was no significant difference in the rate of atypical 
      endometrial hyperplasia between the mifepristone treatment group and the placebo 
      group. CONCLUSION(S): Mifepristone significantly reduced uterine and leiomyoma 
      volume and alleviated leiomyoma-related symptoms. We recommend 2.5 mg of 
      mifepristone administered daily for 3 or 6 months as the optimum clinical 
      treatment for leiomyoma. There is insufficient evidence that mifepristone 
      treatment led to atypical endometrial hyperplasia.
